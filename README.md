## Contribution guidelines

### Icon naming
New icons should be placed in `src/icons` or an additional sub-folder below `src/icons`. File name should be the plain
name of the icon, as it should be referenced later on in the markup. Don't use any unnecessary prefixes like 'icon.' or
'icon-'.

### Icon format
As the conversion libraries do have some limitations regarding certain svg features, icons should be uploaded in a
compatible format, which only uses path elements (see the already existing icons for reference).
